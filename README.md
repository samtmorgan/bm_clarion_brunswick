# App for a property marketing suite

- Used on a tablet to control the lighting in an interactive model of a new
  property development which allows the user to see where different apartments are located
  in the development.
- The client had a small budget for this project so we produced a minimal single page app to get the job done.
- This was a project I built in 2021 when I was still working as a Model Maker and learning the basics of JavaScript and jQuery, so in hindsight the code is not as clean as I would like it to be. I have included it here as an example of my work and to show how far I have come since then.
- The app controls the lighting via the lighting controller API.
- In production the app is hosted locally on a Apache web server running on a Raspberry pi.
